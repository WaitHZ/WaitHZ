# Who is WaitHZï¼Ÿ

Hi, My name is **Wait Horizon's Zephyr**. 

I am currently studying undergraduate degree in **computer science** at **Zhejiang University**.

I usually get more exposure to **C and C++** in class, but now I have joined Teacher Yang Yi's artificial intelligence laboratory, so I will also learn a lot of knowledge related to **Python, machine learning and computer vision**.

In addition to software, I also need to learn some hardware courses, so I will write some **verilog** codes; and since I have minored in some other subjects, there may also be some **Matlab** and **robot-related content**.

All in all, I am still an undergraduate student. Although I am full of curiosity about the computer world, I do not yet have strong algorithm and coding skills. What I share is more of my usual practice. If there are any mistakes, you are welcome to point them out.
